# Pomodoro Timer

## About

This web application features a timer that allows the user to work using the Pomodoro method. The Pomodoro method is a working/studying method that effectively and efficiently helps people get work done by cycling through working time and break time. Typically, a person will work for 25 minutes, then take a break for 5 minutes. After four sets of this, a longer break, typically 15 minutes long, will be taken.

## The Application

The web application features a countdown clock that can be started, paused, and reset. While the clock is at its initial time (either at the beginning of a session or after it is reset), users will be able to edit the countdown to their desired number of minutes for the current type of session (i.e., work/short break/long break). Once this is changed, future sessions of this type will automatically begin with the user-entered time. After the first working session has passed, an alert will be displayed that signals the end of the session. After clicking "OK", the break session can begin. After four sets, a long break session will begin. Above the clock, there is a label that describes the what you should be doing at this time (i.e., working or taking a break).
